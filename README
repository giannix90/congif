congif
======

This is  an experimental tool  that generates GIF animations  of console
sessions.  Like  scriptreplay(1),  it  reads the  output  of  script(1),
including timing information. Unlike  scriptreplay(1), congif parses the
session dialogue and encodes it as a GIF animation that can be viewed on
graphical programs (e.g. web browsers).


Limitations
-----------

Only dialogues generated  for the Linux console can  be correctly parsed
by congif.  This means that  if your  $TERM environment variable  is not
"linux" then  it probably won't  work. You  can manually set  $TERM when
calling script(1), but  then your terminal may not  work correctly while
the session is recorded. It's  recommended that you record your sessions
on  the  Linux  console  itself,  or on  a  terminal  emulator  that  is
compatible with console_codes(4).

congif needs  to know  the terminal  size used  during the  execution of
script(1) and this size must be constant per session (i.e. if you resize
the terminal while recording a  session, congif won't work). By default,
congif assumes  that the terminal  size of the  session is equal  to the
current terminal size. Use the options -w  and -h if you need to specify
a different size.


Building
--------

A C99 compiler is needed. There are no library dependencies.

$ make


Usage
-----

congif [options] timings dialogue

    timings:       File generated by script(1)'s -t option
    dialogue:      File generated by script(1)'s regular output

    options:
      -o output    File name of GIF output
      -l count     GIF loop count (0 = infinite loop)
      -f font      File name of MBF font to use
      -h lines     Terminal height
      -w columns   Terminal width
      -c on|off    Show/hide cursor
      -q           Quiet mode (don't show progress bar)
      -v           Verbose mode (show parser logs)
-------------------------------------------------------
      additional options:
        -i y|n            Put info on the gif, about # of frame and timing
        -s sampling       Fix the sampling of the gif in terms of fps
        -r reproduction   Fix the speed of replay in terms of fps
           speed 
        -x x_coord        Position of info box in the x-axis
        -y y_coord        Position of info box in the y-axis
        -n number_mode    1: Show only the time counter
                          2: Show only the frame counter
                          3: Show the time counter and frame counter (by Default)


Fonts
-----

For  simplicity, congif  uses a  custom font  format, MBF.  The font
misc-fixed [1], included in this distribution, is used by default.


Examples
--------

Recording a session:
$ script -t 2> foo.t foo.d

Generating a GIF file with defaults (creates "con.gif"):
$ congif foo.t foo.d

Generating a faster version:
$ congif -d3 -m1 -o fast.gif foo.t foo.d
