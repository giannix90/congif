.TH CONGIF 1
.SH NAME
congif \- convert \fBscript(1)\fR output to GIF
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B congif
[options] \fItimings\fR \fIdialogue\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcongif\fR is an experimental tool that generates GIF animations of console
sessions. Like \fBscriptreplay(1)\fR, it reads the output of \fBscript(1)\fR,
including timing information. Unlike \fBscriptreplay(1)\fR, \fBcongif\fR parses
the dialogue and encodes it as a GIF animation.
.PP
\fItimings\fR is the path to a file generated by \fBscript(1)\fR's \fB\-t\fR
option.
.PP
\fIdialogue\fR is the path to a file generated by \fBscript(1)\fR's regular
output (also known as \fItypescript\fR).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIoutput\fR
set the file name of the resulting GIF.
.PP
The default is \fIcon.gif\fR.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fImaxdelay\fR
set the maximum delay (in seconds), as in \fBscriptreplay(1)\fR
.PP
When this option is specified, the delay of each frame will be limited to
\fImaxdelay\fR. This option is applied before \fB\-d\fR when both are specified.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIdivisor\fR
set the delay divisor, as in \fBscriptreplay(1)\fR
.PP
When this option is specified, each frame delay will be divided by \fIdivisor\fR,
resulting in a sped-up animation. For instance, \fB\-d 2\fR will make a GIF that
is twice as fast as the real session recorded.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fIcount\fR
make a looping animation
.PP
The resulting GIF will instruct viewers to display the animation \fIcount\fR
times. The special \fIcount\fR value of \fB0\fR will make the GIF loop forever.
.PP
When this option is not specified, \fBcongif\fR will not add looping information
to the GIF file. For most GIF viewing programs, this is equivalent to
\fB\-l 1\fR.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIfont\fR
select the bitmap font to be used in the output
.PP
\fIfont\fR must be the path to a MBFv1 bitmap font. \fBcongif\fR comes with a
default font that will be used when this option is not given.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fIlines\fR \fB\-w\fR \fIcolumns\fR
set the terminal size of the session to \fIlines\fR and \fIcolumns\fR
.PP
\fBcongif\fR needs to know the size of the terminal on which the session was
recorded. By default, it uses the current size of the terminal on which
\fBcongif\fR is being executed.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIswitch\fR
specify whether to show or hide the cursor in the animation
.PP
If \fIswitch\fR is \fB0\fR or \fBoff\fR, the cursor will be hidden during the
entire animation. If \fIswitch\fR is \fB1\fR or \fBon\fR, the cursor will be
shown as in the recorded session (this is the default).
.PP
Note that most terminal programs can hide or show the cursor themselves
appropriately. This option is only necessary to deal with programs that do not
hide the cursor when they should, as is the case in programs targetting old
terminals that might not have cursor hiding capabilities.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
set quiet mode
.PP
The progress bar will not be shown.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
set verbose mode
.PP
The dialogue parser will write logs to stderr.
.SH BUGS
\fBcongif\fR can only parse dialogues recorded in the Linux console or any other
terminal emulator that is compatible with \fBconsole_codes(4)\fR.
.PP
It is not possible to automatically determine the size of the terminal where the
session was recorded. If the correct size is not given via \fB\-h\fR and
\fB\-w\fR, \fBcongif\fR will not be able to generate an accurate animation.
